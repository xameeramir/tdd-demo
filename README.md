As a product owner, I wanted to implement login functionality so that the users can authenticate themselves to the system.

Acceptance criteria:

- login form should accept email and password
- email & password fields should not be null
- minimum length of password should be 8 chars
- email id needs to be valid
- on signin, success message should be shown
